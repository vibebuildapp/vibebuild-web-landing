Animation or Motion Rules;

1. Use existing/add new to [Motion.tsx](mdc:src/components/Motion.tsx) then implement to page tsx without causing broken layout or style changes or even uggly sharp corner, make sure they are working.
2. Motion.tsx usage should simply wrap the main element like a provider, without any props. so only accept children without classname etc
3. Motion.tsx should eliminate the needs of framer-motion direct import to page tsx while also removing any motion props
