**(Sub-headline - Frames the problem and the unified solution)**
"Vibe Coding" with LLMs is the fastest route to a failed project. It creates a brittle, insecure, and unmaintainable codebase that will cripple your velocity and burn your budget. **Compose Code** is the definitive engineering framework for using LLMs to build production-grade, full-stack applications.

This is the new professional standard for founders who need speed, engineers who demand quality, and artisans who value craftsmanship.

**(Headline)**
## From Chaotic "Vibe" to Composed Masterpiece.

**(Sub-headline)**
On the left: a product that's fast, fragile, and doomed to fail. On the right: the same product, built with the **Compose Code** frameworkâ€”fast, robust, and built to last. The difference is not magic; it's discipline.

**(Split-screen visual: A stark "Before & After" or "Liability vs. Asset" comparison.)**

**[LEFT SIDE: The "Vibe Coded" Liability]**

`[UI Image: A slightly disjointed UI. It works, but it feels fragile and generic.]`

**The Code That Breeds Bugs & Burnout:**
```jsx
// BuggyUserProfile.jsx - A 400-line monolith of despair.
function UserProfile({ id, userSettings, perms }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState({});
  // Which one of these 5 useEffects runs first? Good luck.
  useEffect(() => { /* ... tangled data fetching ... */ });
  // ... another useEffect for settings ...

  // Every dev will be too scared to touch this function.
  const handleUpdate = () => { /* ... 20 lines of imperative logic ... */ };

  return (
    // What does this div do? No one knows.
    <div className="p-4 border-2 border-red-400">
      {/* ... more spaghetti with security holes ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**[RIGHT SIDE: The "Composed" Asset]**

`[UI Image: The same UI, but it's polished, pixel-perfect, and looks like a premium, professionally designed application.]`

**The Code That Inspires Confidence & Velocity:**
```jsx
// components/page/ProfileCard.reuse.tsx
import { useProfileData } from '@/hooks/useProfileData';
import { Layout, Spinner, ErrorBoundary } from '@/components';
// Stateless, declarative, and a joy to read and test.
export const ProfileCard = ({ userId }) => {
  const { data, isLoading } = useProfileData(userId);
  if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <Layout.Card>{/* ... Clean, semantic, and reusable JSX ... */}</Layout.Card>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
};

// state-management/hooks/useProfileData.hook.ts
// All complex logic is encapsulated here. Simple to maintain.
export const useProfileData = (userId) => { /* ... */ };
```

#### **â–º FAQ Section (Added to address final objections)**

**(Headline)**
## Your Questions, Answered.

**Q: Why a subscription and not a one-time purchase?**
A: Because the world of AI development is not static. Models, tools, and best practices change weekly. Your subscription ensures your playbook is a **living document** that stays on the cutting edge, so you always have the most effective system. A one-time purchase would be obsolete in three months.

**Q: Is this for absolute beginners?**
A: This is for developers, CTOs, and founders who are comfortable with a modern tech stack (React, TypeScript, etc.) but want a professional system for building with LLMs. It's not a "learn to code" course; it's a "learn to build with AI like an architect" system.

**Q: What if my stack is different?**
A: The playbook is built on a Vite, React, Tailwind, Jotai, and Drizzle stack. However, the **Compose Coding principles**â€”frontend-first architecture, systematic decomposition, and precision prompt engineeringâ€”are universal and will make you a more effective developer on any stack.

**Q: What happens in the Discord community?**
A: Itâ€™s a professional, high-signal space. No fluff. Itâ€™s for asking questions about the workflow, getting feedback on your code, sharing new AI techniques, and networking with other serious builders who are actively using the framework.
